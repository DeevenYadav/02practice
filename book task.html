<p>Mia Jacob lives in the Community – an oppressive cult in western Massachusetts where contact with the outside world is forbidden and books are considered evil. Despite strict rules, Mia finds one book: The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Although it was written almost two hundred years earlier, Mia can’t believe how much she relates to Hawthorne’s writing, as her own mother Ivy had her when she was a teenager and had no other options except to be sent away. Mia feels like the book was written just for her. As she abandons the rules she was raised with, she further discovers the power of books…but just how powerful are they? Can she actually learn to travel back in time and meet Nathaniel Hawthorne? New York Times bestselling author Alice Hoffman’s latest novel weaves the past and present together through themes of heartbreak, self-discovery and even magic.</p>

<p>On a family orchard in Northern Michigan, spring has arrived and it’s time to harvest the cherries. But due to the pandemic, Lara Nelson; her husband Joe; and their daughters, Emily, Maisie and Nell, must pick all the fruit themselves. To pass the time while working, and prompted by the recent death of famous actor Peter Duke, Lara’s daughters beg their mother to tell them the story of her own romance with Duke years ago, when they were acting together in a theater company called Tom Lake. She recalls the story of her love affair with the late actor during this formative period in her life, but she only shares some of it with her daughters – who, upon hearing the tale, are moved to examine their own lives and their relationship with their mother. </p>
